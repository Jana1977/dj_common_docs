GIT COMMANDS:

> git init
	* It initializes the .git folder and mostly there is no need to go here. 
	* after running this command it displays ins tdout " Initialized empty git repository in path---- "
	* Running this command alone in a folder with files will not add the existing files to the staging area - for that we have to use the "git add" cmd.

> git config --global user.name 'janarthana Subramani'
> git config --global user.email 'datajilla@gmail.com'

> git add <file>
	* adds the files in the project to the staging area/index

> git status
	* Check status of working tree

> git commit
	* Commit changes in Index
	* Takes everything from the staging area and put all into the local repository
	* git commit 

> git push
	* push local repo to remote

> git pull
	* Pull latest from Remote Repo

> git clone
	* Copy a remote repo into your current folder
	* Clone using the link after going to a new folder where we want the repo to be copied. 

> git branch mybranch
	* Creates a branch

> git checkout mybranch
	* switches to that branch 
	* this is similar to how I created a branch "feature/da-11712-new-dag-supp-optout" in Sourcetree
	* Once i am here then whatever files i create are being tracked side this branch. 
	* Switch back and forth master and branch to see if the changes are missing in master. 

> git merge mybranch 
	* Run this command after checking out to the master branch
	* This will merge all changes from mybranch to the master
	* also use the -m for inline merging with comments

> git remote 
	* This command gives if there is any remote repository and in my case it showed the origin.

		TFGELSOS3516547:airflow-media-edm jsubramani$ git remote
		origin		
	* if not added then we have to run the below command 
	* git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/myappsample.git

> to push to the remote repositiory master branch run the command below (will ask to provide credentials)
	* git push -u origin master
	* After adding the remote repo the above command need not run again and just push would do it.
	* git push
